# LungCancerIdentification
Identification of Lung Cancer in Smoker Person Using Ensemble Methods Based on Gene Expression Data. Presented in IC2IE 2022 and published to IEEE.

## Abstract
Cancer is a symptom of abnormal cell growth and is uncontrollable. Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. Early detection is very important because it can prevent lung cancer so that it gets the right treatment such as a low-dose CT scan (LDCT). However, this effort still has drawbacks. With advances in DNA microarray technology, it is possible to measure the gene expression level of thousands of genes or cells in each tissue. That identification of lung cancer can be done using machine learning from the gene expression data (DNA microarray). In this study, a machine learning prediction model has been built using the Ensemble Methods, i.e. Random Forest and AdaBoost. The best model is Random Forest with 900 features and get 0.77 for accuracy score and 0.80 for f1 score.
